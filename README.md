## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Git installed (optional, if cloning the repo)
- Optional: VS Code for easy execution and viewing of files

### 2. Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/SnehaSharma00/OS_lab_assignments.git
cd "OS_assignment"

### Assignment 1: Process Creation and Management 
* File: process_management.py
* Output: output.txt

#### Steps to Run
Windows

cd OS_assignment1
python process_management.py

Linux

cd OS_assignment1
python3 process_management.py


The program executes all tasks, including process creation, command execution, simulated zombie/orphan processes, and process info inspection. Output is saved in output.txt.

#### Tasks Covered
1. Process creation using Python's multiprocessing

2.  Execute system commands using subprocess

3. Simulated zombie and orphan processes

4. Inspect current process info

5. Simulated process prioritization

### Assignment 2: System Startup Simulation 
* File: system_startup.py
* Output: process_log.txt

#### Steps to Run

Windows:

cd OS_assignment2
python system_startup.py

Linux:

cd OS_assignment2
python3 system_startup.py


process_log.txt will contain timestamped logs of process execution.

#### Tasks Covered
1. Initialize logging for process events

2. Define dummy process tasks

3. Create and start multiple processes concurrently

4. Ensure proper termination and logging

#### Notes
> Both scripts are cross-platform compatible.

> Ensure Python is added to your system PATH.

> output.txt and process_log.txt files are auto-generated by the scripts.

> Use python for Windows and python3 for Linux.
